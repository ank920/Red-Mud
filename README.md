Red mud—bauxite residue from alumina refining—is one of the largest unmanaged industrial waste streams on earth. Our technology converts this long-term environmental liability into a domestic source of critical minerals, including Scandium and Rare Earth Elements (REEs), while permanently reducing legacy stockpiles.

Outcome:
• Strategic minerals recovered
• Storage liabilities eliminated
• No new mining, no tailings expansion
• Immediate pathway to commercial deployment
